# Initial Notes for dimensions

## Pixel 7 (Mobile size in general)

<img src="Pixel-7-Dimensions 412x915.png" alt="Pixel 7 size" height="700px">

- As you can see, the search bar is cut off, along with the two circles that appear next to the search bar
- Copyright is cut off as well
- I changed the height to 700px to fit on one page, FYI. Original height is 915px
- **SUGGESTION**
  - I know our app isn't tailored for mobile, however, would it be possible to a hamburger menu if someone is on mobile? If it's not a priority or needed, we can ignore this suggestion.

## Tablet screen

<img src="Tablet Size 768x896.png" alt="generic tablet like an ipad">

- Everything shows up on the screen
- **Observation**
  - Does the right side where the image is going to go look kind of small to y'all?

## Laptop Monitor

<img src="Laptop Size 1024x896.png" alt="general laptop screen">

- Everything shows up properly.
- **QUESTION**
  - Does our left side with the logo and options take up too much space for this screen size?

## 1440P Monitor

<img src="./1440p Monitor Size 1440x896.png" alt="1440p monitor for hardcore gamers">

- Everything shows up on screen
- **OBSERVATION**
  - This looks like the sweet-spot in terms of spacing for me. If I was a user, this kind of layout is one I would enjoy.
  - Also, do you think our colors are kind of dark? Perhaps it will look better after we populate the screen.

## 4K Monitor

<img src="4K Monitor Size 2560x1378.png" alt="4K monitor. Fun fact, we don't really see in 4k">

- Everything shows up on screen.
- Copyright logo could be centered better
- **OBSERVATION**
  - It looks too wide now, right? This screen size is for multiple photos, in ,my opinion

## Final Thoughts

1. Great first web-page.
2. Don't read an observation or suggestion and suddenly start trying to do `@media` or `margin-top` or something like that. We can discuss as a team.
